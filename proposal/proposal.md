## 1. Introduction

Our general question is to investigate the trend of vaccination in
Scotland over time from multiple groups of people and perspectives. We
will mainly use one data set which is “Daily Trend of Vaccinations by
Age Group and Sex”. The data is from The Scottish Health and Social Care
Open Data Platform which is managed by Public Health Scotland. There are
several variables in this data set, such as Date, country, sex, Age
group, Population, Dose, Number Vaccinated, Percent Coverage, Cumulative
Number Vaccinated, Cumulative percent Coverage. In short, this data set
has 19 columns(variables) and 26628 rows (observations).

Link:<https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/9b99e278-b8d8-47df-8d7a-a8cf98519ac1>

These are some explanation for some important variables.

-   `Date`: Date on which vaccination occurred.
-   `Country`: 9-digit country code for Scotland.
-   `Sex`: Sex of individual.
-   `SexQF`: Qualifier for Sex.
-   `Agegroup`: Age group of individual. COVID-19 vaccines are not
    routinely recommended for children and young people under 16 years
    of age so this age group is not included in the table.
-   `AgeGroupQF`: Qualifier for AgeGroup
-   `Population`: Number of individuals in the cohort.
-   `PopulationQF`: Qualifier for population.
-   `Dose`: A 2-dose schedule is advised for all vaccine types in the
    current vaccination programme. Total includes both Dose 1 and Dose 2
    vaccines administered.
-   `DoseQF`: Qualifier for Dose.
-   `NumberVaccinated`: Number of individuals who have received the
    vaccine
-   `NumberVaccinatedQF`: Qualifier for NumberVaccinated
-   `PercentCoverage`: Percentage of cohort having received vaccination.
    Percent coverage is calculated using the NRS Scotland 2020 mid-year
    population estimates by age and sex.
-   `PercentCoverageQF`: Qualifier for PercentCoverage
-   `CumulativeNumberVaccinated`: Cumulative number of individuals who
    have received the vaccine.
-   `CumulativeNumberVaccinatedQF`: Qualifier for
    CumulativeNumberVaccinated
-   `CumulativePercentCoverage`: Cumulative percentage of cohor having
    received vaccination. Percent coverage is calculated using the NRS
    Scotland 2020 mid-year populations by age and sex.
-   `CumulativePercentCoverageQF`: Qualifier for
    CumulativePercentCoverage

## 3. Data analysis plan

Data analysis demonstrates the relationship or trend of data. We will
plan to use different visualizations to deal with the variables we
interested. As shown above, we have planed to use tidyverse and ggplot
to draw plots which will improve the visualization of data. If we will
use more tools in the future of analysis, we will add that tools into
our plan.

In order to have a specific data analysis plan, we had defined the
outcome (Trend of total vaccinations) and the predictor (Age group and
sex) for our research questions. We plan to tidying the dataset firstly,
which could provide us a clear view of what data is telling us about.

After that, some plots will be drawn in order to assist our research.
For instance, we will draw a violin plot associate with the different
age group and total vaccinations. And that violin graph will reveals the
distribution of vaccinations among different age groups. For the
variables which have both x and y, we will draw a line plot to
visualized. Because we have different age group, we are going to colored
the different age group with different color. Comparison between color
could provide more information about the data.

Moreover, for the data only valid in plotting scatter points, we plan to
have a linear regression line of our plot which can reveal the
relationship between the points. We will also calculate correlation
coefficient to figure out whether sex is associate with the number of
vaccinations or not.
