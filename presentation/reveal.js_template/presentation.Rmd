# Dataset we are using{data-background-image="img/background2.jpg"}
The data is from The Scottish Health and Social Care Open Data Platform which is managed by Public Health Scotland. There are several variables in this data set, such as Date, country, sex, Age group, Population, Dose, Number Vaccinated, Percent Coverage, Cumulative Number Vaccinated, Cumulative percent Coverage.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs (\$...\$), e.g. $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
